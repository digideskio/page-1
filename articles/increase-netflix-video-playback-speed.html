<h2>title: Increase Video Playback Speed on Netflix
layout: default</h2>
<p>Like some other <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/2ikk00/questionmeta_can_i_speed_up_the_playback_of_movies/">people on the internet</a> I was frustrated that I couldn't speed up the playback speed of Netflix videos like I got used to on YouTube.</p>
<p>With this little peace of code one can easily increase the playback speed of the main video:</p>
<pre><code>document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].playbackRate = 1.2
</code></pre>
<p>Turns out it is not as generally useful as increasing <a href="/2015/02/22/increased-podcast-playback-speeds.html">podcast playback speeds</a>, though.<br />
While speedier dialogues are great, the unnatural fast body movements at higher speeds distract me a lot.</p>
