Just a quick thanks to Marco Arment for his Smart Speed feature in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/).

Smart Speed combined with regular playback speed-ups allows me to easily listen to interview podcasts at speeds greater than 1.5x.

For example I was able to listen to [these two parts of the Tim Ferriss Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/10/15/money-master-the-game/) (2h07m total) and [this episode of the James Altucher Show](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/11/robbins/) (1h04m) both interviewing [Tony Robbins](http://www.tonyrobbins.com/) about [his new book](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00MZAIU4G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B00MZAIU4G&linkCode=as2&tag=gummibaerchen-21&linkId=2NTA2WZFCGR66HJA) in the same amount of time than just listening to the former at 1x.

For me personally I can confirm [Marcoâ€™s assumption](http://www.marco.org/2015/02/17/listen-to-podcasts-at-whatever-speed-you-want), that listening to podcasts faster just makes me listen to more podcasts.
