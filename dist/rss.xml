    <title><![CDATA[An Asynchronous Web API in 1994]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>An Asynchronous Web API in 1994</h1>
<p>After going down a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15898919">Hacker News</a> initiated rabbit hole, I crossed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxQw4CdxLr8">Donald Knuth's 2017 Christmas Lecture</a> and from there ended up on the <a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.</p>
<p>For every integer sequence you provide, it lists the known occurrences and, if available, formulae that can be used to generate them.</p>
<p>One interesting detail is, that every page still had a &quot;generated in <em>N</em> seconds&quot; footer, where <em>N</em> often was &gt; 5s for my test queries. So it seems like searching 295.000 possible sequences still takes a little computing time, even on modern hardware.</p>
<p>But while getting an answer on modern hardware in a few seconds is acceptable, let's image how much longer this might've taken a few year back.</p>
<p>In order to offer advanced searches and explain sequences a new service was established in 1994: <a href="http://oeis.org/ol.html">&quot;Superseeker&quot;</a>. As this services does some &quot;serious computing&quot;, we can take a guess at how much longer it must've taken to complete a query.</p>
<p>So in order to offer this at that time (where homes still had per-minute dial-up), the search API was implemented  on top of plain e-mail.</p>
<p>That way the server could take as long as it needed to generate a response, and the sender would be notified as soon as possible once the calculation was done. What a beautifully simple approach.</p>
<hr />
<p>Software based on the original bunch of shell scripts from back then is still in use and it's source code is available <a href="http://oeis.org/ol_source.txt">here</a>.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Sam Harris: Lying]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sam Harris: Lying</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q: What is lying?<br />
A: &quot;To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.&quot;[^1]</p>
<p>At this point it is important to differentiate between telling the truth and being truthful. In my understanding of Harris' text, one is lying when &quot;believing one thing while intending to communicate another&quot; (i.e. not truthful). I am unclear on what is made of uttering statements one believes to be true, but which are objectively false.</p>
<p>Harris further advocates for telling the truth, as it is just easier. Instead of keeping track of a made-up story, &quot;we can simply be ourselves&quot;.</p>
<h2>2 Types of Lies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Acts of comission: &quot;Bad things we do&quot;</li>
<li>Acts of omission: &quot;Good things we fail to do&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Harris the former are viewed more harshly than the latter. Also it could be impractical or infeasible to clarify every (unimportant) misunderstanding in which case an act of omission might be justifiable.</p>
<h2>On &quot;White Lies&quot;</h2>
<p>Often times people think they're helping by telling these, but Harris lists a plethora of examples were white lies have a detrimental effect not only on the receiver, but also the sender.</p>
<p>A common area of this seems to be around medical issues, where family members keep each other in the dark about the actual situation, leading to lost &quot;opportunities for deepening love, compassion, forgiveness, and understanding&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Children do not learn to tell white lies until around the age of four, after they have achieved a hard-won awareness of the mental states of others.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;False encouragement is a kind of theft: it steals time, energy, and motivation a person could put toward some other purpose.&quot;[^2]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Illusory Truth Effect</h2>
<p>&quot;[...] people will recall [something] as fact [...] even if they were first exposed to it in the context of its debunking.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is. Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make — and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The whole book is a short read.</em></p>
<p>[^1]: According to studies quoted in the book, &quot;10% of communication between spouses is deceptive&quot;, and &quot;38% of encounters among college students contain lies&quot;.</p>
<p>[^2]: This to me is currently a major argument against acts of omission, and forces my conscience to consider clarifying implicit but also incorrect understandings and assumptions.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Rich Hickey: Step Away from the Computer]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rich Hickey: Step Away from the Computer</h1>
<p><em>Also known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock Driven Development</a></em></p>
<p>Opening Question: When was the last time you thought hard about something for</p>
<ul>
<li>an hour?</li>
<li>a day?</li>
<li>over the course of a month?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Key Note&quot; talk by Rich Hickey focussing on the problem solving aspect of programming, which in his experience is influenced and successful due to a lot of thinking without the computer at hand.</p>
<p>He starts out with the well-established data point that bugs are most costly when they have to fixed in production and that it would be preferable to fix them during development.<br />
Then he goes backwards one step further and suggest that bugs are least expensive to prevent in the <em>design</em> of the software.<br />
Relating to this, it is his understanding that &quot;the biggest problems in software are problems of misconceptions&quot;. When not the actual problems at hand are solved, but rather an attempt is made at solving perceived problems or problems arising solely from the suggested &quot;solution&quot;.</p>
<p>Another interesting section was about tradeoffs, a word often used to justify a rushed or not fully tested implementation. According to Hickey a real tradeoff requires at least 2 possible solutions, which are then weighed and, finally, one is picked. Once you made a tradeoff, he suggests to record your reasoning and the decision in writing.</p>
<p>The major problem this talk focuses on, going back to the opening question, is that not enough <em>thought</em> is put into the problem solving aspect of software development (which after all is the whole purpose of writing programs commercially).</p>
<p>Speaking of the mind Hickey starts out describing it as two parts: the &quot;Waking Brain&quot; and the &quot;Background Brain&quot;. According to Hickey the first one is very tactical, while the second one is strategical, abstracts, has a great ability to synthesize. Unfortunately the &quot;Background Brain&quot; can't be used directly, but rather will work on what is most prominent in the &quot;Waking Brain&quot;. The way to get the &quot;Background Brain&quot; to work on what one desires, is to &quot;load it up&quot;.</p>
<p>In order to do this, one foremost has to be aware that the &quot;Background Brain&quot; can only work on 7±2 problems. So how does one deal with designs that have more than 9 parts? According to Hickey a limited subset of problems should be picked and focused on those.<br />
Once the problems to be uploaded are picked, the currently proposed solution (from the &quot;Waking Brain&quot;) should be written down.</p>
<p>Then one should go over the picked problems in varying orders.</p>
<p>With all this preparation done, now the hammock comes into play. This &quot;mind's eye time&quot; — lying down with your eyes closed and thinking uninterruptedly — is an integral part of the process.</p>
<p>Whenever you &quot;hear back&quot; from your &quot;Background Brain&quot;, depending on the situation you might want to act on it immediately, or just take note of the proposed solution. Preferably in writing.</p>

    <title><![CDATA["Kevin Maney: Trade-Off"]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>&quot;Kevin Maney: Trade-Off&quot;</h1>
<p><em>A Kindle Sample Review</em></p>
<p>After a lengthy foreword, the excerpt from the book was only a 2 page introduction and the prologue, or beginning thereof so most of this review does is not actually based on Maney's writing.</p>
<p>Luckily the foreword by Jim Collins already refers to and summarizes some points from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maney came to the conclusion, that the &quot;best people [...] have the courage to make rigorous choices&quot;</li>
<li>Basic concept: &quot;rigorous choices between high-fidelity and high-convenience&quot;
<ul>
<li>fidelity: &quot;being something special and hard to get&quot;</li>
<li>convenience: &quot;being easily accessible, even at the expense of quality&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Collins the books &quot;does not in itself gives answers about what you should do, and not do. Rather [...] it forces you to engage in a powerful question, [...] from which you derive your own insight [...]&quot;.</p>
<p>Quoting Maney: &quot;You have to make trade-offs to become distinctive, rather than merely employable.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Collins describes Maney's job description as &quot;Kevin Maney&quot;, suggesting that he has successfully done just that.</p>
<p>Maney starts the book with trade-off examples from the movie industry. How Netflix stuck to DVDs even though basic streaming was available (but the CEO believed in the quality advantage of DVDs over the convenience of streaming of the time)[^1], and how Hollywood jumped on the 3D bandwagon to keep people going to the theaters.</p>
<p>[^1]: Attributed to Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix): People are willing to trade the quality of an experience for the convenience of getting it, and vice versa.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Lawrence Block: Telling Lies for Fun & Profit]]></title>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Lawrence Block: Telling Lies for Fun &amp; Profit</h1>
<p><em>A Kindle Sample Review</em></p>
<p>Subtitle: A Manual for Fiction Writers</p>
<p>Sue Grafton states in the introduction that she refers to this book before starting any project. Her favorite advice from the book includes: &quot;writing to please yourself&quot;, and &quot;daily work-commitment&quot; through page-quotas.</p>
<p>The book branches off from a column Block wrote for &quot;Writer's Digest&quot;.</p>
<p>In the first chapter Block talks about that it's not enough to want to be a writer, you have to (want to) write <em>something</em>. According to him, one has to be able to read and enjoy the genre one is going to write it. More than sympathizing with the characters, one has to sympathize with the <em>author</em> of those characters. As with the monthly columns, he takes writing great novels a little bit on faith, hoping that &quot;sooner or later [he] will get it right&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 goes deeper into the aspect of acquiring knowledge of related works in the field, which in his case means reading a ton of magazines and books in the given genre. Block was buying back issues of all notable publications and read them cover to cover, the good and the bad, which he was gradually getting better at identifying. Block further suggest to &quot;outline what you've read&quot; in order to &quot;increase the effectiveness of your reading&quot;.</p>
