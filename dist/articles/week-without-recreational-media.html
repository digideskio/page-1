    <h1>7 Days Without Recreational Media</h1>
<p><em>If I didn‚Äôt write this today‚Äîright now even‚ÄîI‚Äôd never do it.</em></p>
<p>Over that last 7 days I‚Äôve been going on a ‚Äúrecreational media hiatus‚Äù‚Äîmeaning not reading, listening to, or watching anything that is not <em>directly applicable</em> to the work at hand.</p>
<p>While there is a current trend to ignore specific social networks for a while, this included every single <em>leisurely used</em><sup id="fa_0"><a href="#fn_0">0</a></sup> information source, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books not concerned with the current day‚Äôs task</li>
<li>Any Blogs, News Site, Aggregators (&quot;push&quot; content)</li>
<li>Podcasts and Audio Books</li>
<li>E-Mail Newsletters<sup id="fa_1"><a href="#fn_1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>TV, Movies, and Radio when alone</li>
</ul>
<p>The only two exceptions I allowed myself was using the Calm app's sleep stories, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Pema-Chodron-Audio-Collection/dp/B000BGZQWA/ref=nav_custrec_signin?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519425072&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=pema+chodron+collection&amp;">Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n meditations collection</a>. I anticipated that I wouldn‚Äôt want to spent every minute alone doing work or nothing at all, so getting deeper into meditation seemed like a worthwhile endeavor, one that would hopefully further unclutter and calm my mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>I made the decision to try this for a week, while sitting on a train and skipping into the third audiobook on 1 hour ride. I somehow felt that something must be wrong when I couldn‚Äôt even keep my attention on an audiobook that I chose myself and wanted to, or at least aspired to, listen to.</p>
<p>Similarly I noticed that while taking a break during work (üçÖ), I would often get lost on a tangent like some interesting but obscure technology or some new open source project, which would then far exceed the 5 minute goal time.<br />
While getting input from outside my immediate area of work and interest is generally an inspiring source, oftentimes nothing sticks out and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to recite half of the topics I scratched that day when asked about it before bedtime.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some unordered observations I made throughout the week:</p>
<ul>
<li>As there were much less inputs, every single one of them left way more of an impression, and got more time and thorough thought than in any previous week</li>
<li>The meditation felt much easier, more fruitful as my mind was not cluttered with technical trivia. Instead I was able to better listen to the teachings and myself</li>
<li>A lot of times at night I had neither energy to work on anything specific nor the willingness to listen to mediations, so I just ended up doing nothing‚Äîjust sitting and thinking</li>
<li>In the course of the week, snacking emerged as an alternative distraction/feel good mechanism. Apparently there were some voids to fill</li>
<li>Every bit of personal interaction got more valuable. Before I was often so focused on my reading etc. that I would view everyone else nearby as a distraction. Now I was grateful for conversations</li>
<li>The insights I gained during meditation and the ‚Äújust sitting‚Äù times were profunder than anything I have ever experienced. Instead of just hearing the teachers opinions/experiences/facts, I had some very deep insights emerge from within<sup id="fa_2"><a href="#fn_2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If I ever get to do this again (who knows, maybe by this time tomorrow I am so exhausted from my ‚Äúcheat day‚Äù, that I'll plan doing this regularly), I will definitely prepare myself to not fall into the next trap, i.e. stock up on healthy, boring food.</p>
<p>Other than that I appreciated the change this week, and how it allowed me to reevaluate my day-to-day behavior and see this media consumption in a more honest light:  it's primarily distractions and rewards, which I was voluntarily seeking out‚Äìcraving even. Only secondarily were they are source of information, often neither actionable or acted upon.</p>
<p><b id="fn_0">0</b> <a href="#fa_0">‚Ü©</a> This is an important distinction to make. While often those media are deeply technical in some field, aspirational, or otherwise of importance to some, I often would just read them for recreational purposes: satisfaction and distraction.</p>
<p><b id="fn_1">1</b> <a href="#fa_1">‚Ü©</a> Yep, it‚Äôs not enough these days to ignore specific apps and not visiting specific sites, somehow I justified for a while now to clutter my inbox with non-critical information. If some site only offers e-mail updates, I will not subscribe to them anymore. The overall downside just outweighs any single of those sources. Side-note: <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> has a great service where you can have newsletters/mails shown alongside your RSS subscriptions.</p>
<p><b id="fn_2">2</b> <a href="#fa_2">‚Ü©</a> I think this stems from a mix of the longer time spent doing meditation as well as the different style used on the above mentioned audio collection. It‚Äôs meditation practices framed by teachings into hour-long sessions. This additional time compared to the short 5-15 minute sessions others offer might‚Äôve been a major contributor to this.</p>
